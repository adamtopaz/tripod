# Tripod.Identifications.Fhat2_iso_geomPi1_tripod_over_C

Let `X := P^1_{\mathbf C} \setminus \{0,1,\infty\}` and choose a basepoint. The claim used
here is an isomorphism of profinite groups

`\widehat{F_2} \cong \pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)`,

where `\widehat{F_2}` denotes the profinite completion of the discrete free group `F_2`
(equivalently, the free profinite group on two generators).

Sketch. The topological fundamental group of the thrice-punctured Riemann sphere is the
free group `F_2` (e.g. generated by small loops around `0` and `1`). By Riemann's
existence theorem, finite etale covers of `X` are the same as finite topological covers of
`X(\mathbf C)`, so the etale fundamental group is the profinite completion of the
topological one:

`\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X) \cong \widehat{\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(X(\mathbf C))} \cong \widehat{F_2}`.

As usual, the identification depends on basepoint choices; for basepoint-free statements
one works naturally with outer automorphisms.

See `informal/Tripod/Conventions.md#outer-automorphisms-and-basepoint-free-statements`.

`\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(\mathbf P^1(\mathbf C) \setminus \{0,1,\infty\})`.
