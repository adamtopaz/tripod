# Tripod.arithPi1OverQ

The profinite etale fundamental group of the thrice-punctured projective line
`P^1_Q \ {0, 1, infinity}` with base point over `Q`.

This is the arithmetic fundamental group. It fits into the homotopy exact
sequence
`1 -> pi_1^geom(X_{Qbar}) -> pi_1(X_Q) -> Gal(Qbar/Q) -> 1`
from SGA1 IX.6.1, where the geometric fundamental group is a closed normal
subgroup and the quotient is the absolute Galois group.
