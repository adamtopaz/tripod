# Tripod.step2.geomPi1OverCIsoGeomPi1OverQbar

The base-change isomorphism between the geometric etale fundamental groups over
`C` and over `Qbar`:
`pi_1(P^1_C \ {0,1,infinity}) ~= pi_1(P^1_{Qbar} \ {0,1,infinity})`.

This is an instance of invariance of the etale fundamental group under
algebraically closed base change (SGA1 X.1.8). The isomorphism is induced by
the embedding `Qbar -> C`.
