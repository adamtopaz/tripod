# Tripod.fundamentalExactSequence

The short exact sequence of profinite groups (SGA1 IX.6.1)
`1 -> pi_1(X_{Qbar}) -> pi_1(X_Q) -> Gal(Qbar/Q) -> 1`
for `X = P^1 \ {0, 1, infinity}`.

The inclusion `pi_1(X_{Qbar}) -> pi_1(X_Q)` is the base-change map and the
projection `pi_1(X_Q) -> Gal(Qbar/Q)` is the structure morphism. Both are
continuous homomorphisms of profinite groups, and the sequence is exact: the
image of the inclusion equals the kernel of the projection.
