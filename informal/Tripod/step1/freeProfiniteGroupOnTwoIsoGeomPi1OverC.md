# Tripod.step1.freeProfiniteGroupOnTwoIsoGeomPi1OverC

The canonical isomorphism between the free profinite group on two generators
`Fhat_2` and the geometric etale fundamental group
`pi_1(P^1_C \ {0,1,infinity})`.

This follows from the classical presentation of the topological fundamental
group of the thrice-punctured sphere as the free group on two generators
(the loops around `0` and `1`), combined with Riemann's existence theorem
identifying the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group with
the etale fundamental group.
