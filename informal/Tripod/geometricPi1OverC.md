# Tripod.geometricPi1OverC

The profinite etale fundamental group of the thrice-punctured projective line
`P^1_C \ {0, 1, infinity}` with base point over `C`.

By Riemann's existence theorem (SGA1 XII), this is canonically isomorphic to
the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group
`pi_1^top(P^1(C) \ {0,1,infinity})`, which is the free group on two generators.
